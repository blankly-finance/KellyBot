## How does this work? 

This uses the [blankly package](https://github.com/Blankly-Finance/Blankly) to build a [trading strategy](https://docs.blankly.finance/core/strategy)
We are able to utilize the `Blankly.Strategy` object to easily add our Kelly initialization function that determines our RSI histogram logic and calculations and then easily create a price event that trades off of the calculated Kelly Criterion sizes.

## What is Kelly Criterion?

The [Kelly Criterion](https://blankly.finance/the-kelly-criterion) gives the optimal bet value, given the probabilities of wins and losses as well as the payoffs for each outcome. It works by optimizing the logarithmic growth rate, which leads to the greatest returns in the long term. In portfolio management scenarios, where it's important to both discover opportunities and allocate capital efficiently, the Kelly Criterion is an extremely useful tool.
